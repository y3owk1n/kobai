This file is the **single source of truth** for agent instructions. Every other agent
config in this repo points back here — see [Agent tool scaffold](#agent-tool-scaffold).
When you learn something durable about how kobai should be built, it belongs here, in
`CONTEXT.md`, or in an ADR under `docs/adr/` — not in a tool-specific file.

## Working on kobai

Work flows through the engineering skills configured below:

1. **Fog** — the way from here to a shipped thing isn't visible yet. Chart it with
   `/wayfinder`, which produces **decisions, not deliverables** as linked GitHub issues.
2. **Idea** — sharpen it with `/grill-with-docs`, which records terms in `CONTEXT.md` and
   hard-to-reverse decisions as ADRs under `docs/adr/`.
3. **Build** — `/to-spec` → `/to-tickets` → `/implement` (which drives `/tdd` and closes
   with `/code-review`).
4. **Incoming** — bug reports and feature requests you didn't write go through `/triage`.

Steps 1–3 assume a real issue tracker; this repo uses GitHub Issues.

## Development

**Prerequisites: [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) and Docker. Nothing else.** Node and
pnpm are not expected on your PATH — devbox provides them, and corepack activates the pnpm
pinned in `package.json`. Run every Node command through `devbox run …` or from inside
`devbox shell`.

**The gate is `devbox run ci`.** It is the single command that proves the repository is
green: install, Postgres up, lint, typecheck, build, test. Nothing is done until it passes,
and no PR opens on a red one.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `devbox run ci` | **The gate.** Everything below, in order. |
| `devbox run up` | Postgres and the reference Project. `http://localhost:3000/health`. |
| `devbox run down` | Stop them. `devbox run db:down` also drops the volume. |
| `devbox run db` | Just Postgres — what the test suite needs. |
| `devbox run test` | Postgres up, build, then the whole suite. |
| `devbox run typecheck` / `lint` / `format` / `build` | One step each. |
| `devbox run db:generate` | Build, then generate a migration in every package whose schema changed — Core and each Plugin. |

There is deliberately **no `push` script** anywhere — not in Core, not in a Plugin, not in
the reference Project. `drizzle-kit push` diffs against the live database and silently drops
the tables of every package whose schema it was not given, leaving their tracking rows
behind so the migration runner cannot repair it. See
[ADR-0030](docs/adr/0030-generate-and-migrate-only-never-drizzle-kit-push.md). A `"// …"`
key in `devbox.json` and in each package's `package.json` says so where the command would
have been, and `tests/no-push-script.test.ts` fails the build if one appears in either.

### Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` | `@kobai/core` — the package a Project depends on (ADR-0025). |
| `packages/core/migrations` | Core's migration set. Generated, never hand-edited except for `--custom` files. |
| `packages/plugin-price-log` | `@kobai/plugin-price-log` — a deliberately trivial Plugin. One table, nothing else. |
| `reference/` | The **reference Project** — kobai's own Project and its release gate (ADR-0029). |
| `reference/kobai.config.ts` | The one file listing everything this Project has customised. |
| `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile` | Postgres and the application, and nothing else. |

### Writing tests

The dominant seam is the **public HTTP API, dispatched in-process against a real Postgres**.
Reach for `createTestKobai` from `@kobai/core/testing`: it creates a throwaway database, runs
every migration set into it, and hands back an object you dispatch requests at.

```ts
import { createTestKobai } from "@kobai/core/testing";

await using kobai = await createTestKobai(); // `using` drops the database on the way out
const response = await kobai.request("/admin/store");
```

The **migration seam** covers what HTTP cannot — that sets apply independently, into
separate tracking tables, in any order. Take a harness with `{ migrate: false }` and drive
the runner yourself:

```ts
await using kobai = await createTestKobai({ migrate: false });
await runMigrations(kobai.db, [pluginSet, coreMigrationSet]); // order is yours to choose
```

The **schema seam** covers the rest of what HTTP cannot: ADR-0004's rules are properties of
the schema, not behaviours. Ask Postgres what it is holding, through `inspectSchema` from
`@kobai/core/testing` — never by hand-rolling another `information_schema` query, because
there should be one of those:

```ts
const schema = inspectSchema(kobai.database);

await expect(schema.tablesOwnedBy("price_log")).resolves.toEqual(["price_log_entry"]);
await expect(schema.foreignKeysCrossingInto("core")).resolves.toEqual([]);
await expect(schema.columnsOwnedBy("core")).resolves.toEqual(stockCoreColumns);
```

It also reads `migrationTracking()`, `columnsOf()` and `indexedColumnsOf()`, and it scans
every non-system schema rather than only `public` — the prototype's inspector reported "no
tracking tables" for exactly that reason while they sat in `drizzle` the whole time.

Real Postgres rather than a fake, because under
[ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-plugins-own-their-tables-core-tables-are-closed.md),
[ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-postgres-and-drizzle.md) and ADR-0030 the schema and its migrations
*are* part of the product — a fake skips the thing most likely to break. Assert on response
bodies, status codes and database state; never on internal call sequences or module
structure, which Core reserves the right to change
([ADR-0019](docs/adr/0019-plugins-are-npm-packages-and-semver-covers-only-the-promised-surface.md)).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues on `y3owk1n/kobai`, managed via the `gh` CLI. See
[`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md).

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, each label string equal to its role name. See
[`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`](docs/agents/triage-labels.md).

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See
[`docs/agents/domain.md`](docs/agents/domain.md).

## Agent tool scaffold

kobai is developed from many harnesses. AGENTS.md is the one place instructions live;
everything else is a pointer or a tool-specific concern that genuinely can't live in a
shared file.

| Path | Tool | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex, Cursor, Zed, Amp, OpenCode, Jules, … | **Source of truth.** Read natively. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | Symlink → `AGENTS.md`. |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI | Symlink → `AGENTS.md`. |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot | Symlink → `../AGENTS.md`. |
| `.agents/skills/` | all | **Canonical skills directory.** One folder per skill. |
| `.claude/skills` | Claude Code | Symlink → `../.agents/skills`. |
| `.cursor/rules/` | Cursor | Cursor-only rules that don't belong in the shared file. |
| `.mcp.json` | Claude Code | Project-scoped MCP servers. |
| `.codex/config.toml` | Codex | The same MCP servers, in Codex's format. |
| `docs/agents/` | all | Machine-facing config the engineering skills read. |

**Rule: never add instructions to a tool-specific file that would apply to every tool.**
Put them in AGENTS.md. `.cursor/rules/` earns its place only for things that are true of
Cursor and false elsewhere (its cloud VM, for instance). If you add an MCP server, add it
to **both** `.mcp.json` and `.codex/config.toml` — they are hand-kept in sync.

### Repo-local skills

Skills shared by every harness live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with YAML
frontmatter carrying `name` and a `description` that says **when** to reach for it. To
expose one to Codex, add `.agents/skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml`:

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Human readable name"
  short_description: "One line."
  default_prompt: "Use $skill-name to ..."
```

## Conventions

- **Line endings** are LF everywhere (`.gitattributes` enforces `eol=lf`); Windows
  contributors should not let autocrlf rewrite them.
- **Secrets** never enter the repo. `.env` is gitignored; every variable kobai reads is
  documented in `.env.example`, and a new one goes there in the same commit.
- **Don't create `CONTEXT.md` or `docs/adr/` upfront.** `/domain-modeling` writes them
  lazily, when a term or decision is actually resolved. Their absence is not a problem to
  fix.
